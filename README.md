# Insider-Trading-Analysis

In this repo, I analyse data scraped from Insidertrading.org to find patterns in Insider Trading activities.The data is from August 2018 to December 2017. I look for insights such as distribution of Number of companies to number of Insiders, number of insiders to the number of transactions, top companies for insider activity and market cap of those companies, common roles and sectors for Insider trades. 

I also answer most commonly asked questions in Insider trading , "Whether Insiders are contrarians", "what is the short term effect of Insider transactions in the stock market", "are Insiders farsighted" ? etc.

Insider Trades mostly occur in the form of pairs(Buy/Sell) or triads of Insider Activity. I find and analyze such triads for a Company.

All the conclusions that I reach to are limited to the dataset I've used.
